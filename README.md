## 🚀 About Me

I'm Raghav, a computer science student with a builder's mindset. I believe in learning by doing—shipping code, automating workflows, and exploring security concepts through practical projects. My approach is hands-on: I mix modern frontend frameworks with robust backend architectures, always prioritizing clean, maintainable code and user experience.

**My Philosophy:**

- **Practical over Theoretical**: I learn by building, not by endless reading
- **Security-First**: Every project considers security implications
- **Automation-Driven**: Cron jobs, APIs, and workflows that work for you
- **Debian Linux**: My development environment of choice 🐧
